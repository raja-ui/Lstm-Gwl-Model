# Lstm-Gwl-Model

The LSTM network is implemented to predict Groundwater levels (GWL) using deep learning libraries such as tensorflow, keras and Scikit-Learn. The idea is to predict GWL's and analyse impacts from the pertubed source using natural and non-natural influencing factors in areas with non-natural groundwater regime. 

However, the code is split into 3 parts for the same dataset, 
1) Groundwater predictions
2) Groundwater forecasting 
3) Evaluation of accuracy with unseen data
